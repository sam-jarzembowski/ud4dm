                    <em><strong>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</strong></em> (Spanish: Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios) is a 1988 Spanish black comedy film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, starring Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas and Julieta Serrano. The plot follows actress Pepa, who, after her lover Iván leaves without explanation, sets out to find the reason, and comes across an array of eccentric characters, including Iván's son from a previous relationship and her best friend Candela, who has been held captive by a Shiite terrorist cell.

                    The film brought Almodóvar to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the 1988 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and won five Goya Awards including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It debuted at the 45th Venice International Film Festival and was released on 11 November 1988 in the United States.

                    <em>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</em> received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and is often considered one of Almodóvar's best films. A stage musical opened on Broadway in 2010, adapted by Jeffrey Lane with songs by David Yazbek.

                    The Spanish title refers to an ataque de nervios (attack of the nerves), inexactly translated into English as "nervous breakdown" (crisis nerviosa). Ataques de nervios are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with hysteria and more recently in the scientific literature with post-traumatic stress and panic attacks.

                <p>
                    Pepa and Iván are voice actors who dub foreign films, most recently Johnny Guitar with Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden. Depressed because Iván has left her, Pepa oversleeps, missing a recording session with Iván, and receiving a voicemail message from him asking her to pack his things in a suitcase he will pick up. Arriving at work late after Iván has left, Pepa spends the rest of the day desperately trying to give him an important message.
