            <h2>HOW</h2>

            <h3 id="standards">Web Standards</h3>
            <p>The need for web standards came about in the 1990s when creating websites became a complicated, nonsensical mess of varying technologies and lack of support. Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994 in an effort to make sense of this confusing landscape by creating a standardized set of technologies and protocols. Eventually, through a lot of trial and error, HTML, CSS, and JS became the standards for website creation.</p>

            <h3 id="semantic">Semantic HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p>Certain coding practices in both HTML and CSS can contribute to standardized, more legible, and more accessible websites. </p>
            <p>Hierarchy is key when coding for accessibility in HTML. For instance, the way headers are numbered (h1 through h6) determine how those elements interact with screen readers, tabbing through content, and other accessibility tools. Similarly, coding tables and forms in a standardized fashion ensures they're accessible, regardless of how a user is interacting with them.</p>
            <p>CSS is used to make content look its best, and it can be implemented to improve legibility and clarity. Developers can use CSS to set a maximum width for content, thereby reducing the amount of eye movement necessary to read text. By using CSS flex box and CSS grid, developers can arrange content to fill the page just as they intended.</p>
            <p>While a lot of CSS is just for show, it can also improve accessibility by helping assist various accessibility tools. Skip navigation can be implemented using CSS, which allows those using screen readers to jump right into the main content of a webpage. CSS is also used to hide certain headers or text from the screen that are necessary for use with screen readers but aren't intended to be on screen otherwise.</p>
