            <h2>HOW</h2>

            <h3 id="standards">Web Standards</h3>
            <p>The need for web standards came about in the 1990s when creating websites became a complicated, nonsensical mess of varying technologies and lack of support. Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994 in an effort to make sense of this confusing landscape by creating a standardized set of technologies and protocols. Eventually, through a lot of trial and error, HTML, CSS, and JS became the standards for website creation.</p>

            <h3 id="semantic">Semantic HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p>Certain coding practices in both HTML and CSS can contribute to standardized, more legible, and more accessible websites. </p>
            <p>Hierarchy is key when coding for accessibility in HTML. For instance, the way headers are numbered (h1 through h6) determine how those elements interact with screen readers, tabbing through content, and other accessibility tools. Similarly, coding tables and forms in a standardized fashion ensures they're accessible, regardless of how a user is interacting with them.</p>
            <p>CSS is used to make content look its best, and it can be implemented to improve legibility and clarity. Developers can use CSS to set a maximum width for content, thereby reducing the amount of eye movement necessary to read text. By using CSS flex box and CSS grid, developers can arrange content to fill the page just as they intended.</p>
            <p>While a lot of CSS is just for show, it can also improve accessibility by helping assist various accessibility tools. Skip navigation can be implemented using CSS, which allows those using screen readers to jump right into the main content of a webpage. CSS is also used to hide certain headers or text from the screen that are necessary for use with screen readers but aren't intended to be on screen otherwise.</p>

            <h3 id="responsive">Responsive Websites & Mobile-First Design</h3>
            <p>More and more users are accessing websites from their mobile devices. It's often much more convenient than pulling out a bulky laptop, and you usually always have your phone on you. Thus, it is more important now than ever to design websites and user interactions that work well on mobile devices. The best way to accomplish this is to design for mobile first, ensuring that websites are responsive and look good there first before moving to bigger screens. By using media queries inside of CSS along with grid or flexbox, developers can optimize their sites to work flawlessly on mobile devices like phones.</p>

            <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility Standards</h3>
            <p>Users with disabilities often rely on certain accessibility tools to use technology effectively. Things like screen readers and tabbed navigation allow users to interact with and consume content from webpages.</p>
            <p>Developers are tasked with ensuring their websites are compatible with the various technologies different users rely on. Documentation like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by W3C offer up a set of rules to follow to cater to these users and maximize their experience with webpages. These often go beyond just compatibility, and promote accessible color contrast, font sizes, and other design choices to better the experience for everyone.</p>

            <h3 id="testing">Testing for Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Using WCAG, developers can test their websites for accessibility. Many different programs and browser extensions help to check for accessibility, but at the end of the day, it's important to have a human go through and evaluate everything using different pieces of technology to ensure complete compatibility.</p>
