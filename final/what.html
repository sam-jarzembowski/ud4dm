            <h3 id="principles">Principles of Universal Design</h3>
            <h4>1: Equitable Use</h4>
            <p>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. The design should, from the start, be appealing to all users and ideally provide the same experience for everyone. Designers should avoid segregating or stigmatizing users and should maintain privacy, security, and safety for all users.</p>
            <h4>2: Flexibility in Use</h4>
            <p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. Designers should offer users a variety of methods for use. They should ensure that the design adapts to the user's pace while prioritizing accuracy and precision.</p>
            <h4>3: Simple and Intuitive Use</h4>
            <p>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.The design should not be overly complex or be inconsistent in layout or arrangement.. The experience should be consistent with user expectations and intuition and should provide effecting prompting and feedback. Designers should accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.</p>
            <h4>4: Perceptible Information</h4>
            <p>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. The design should prioritize legibility of essential information and provide adequate contrast between it and its surroundings. Essential information should also be presented redundantly in different manners to ensure understanding.</p>
            <h4>5: Tolerance for Error</h4>
            <p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. Elements should be arranged to minimize unintentional use or action. The design should provide warnings of hazards and errors and incorporate fail-safe features.</p>
            <h4>6: Low Physical Effort</h4>
            <p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. Users should be able to maintain a neutral body position and exert minimal physical effort.</p>
            <h4>7: Size and Space for Approach and Use</h4>
            <p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of a user's body size, posture, or mobility. The design should provide a clear line of sight and access to important elements for all types of users and should be able to accommodate any necessary assistive devices or personal assistance.</p>


            <h3 id="norman">Norman's Design Concepts</h3>
            <h4>Perceived Affordance</h4>
            <p>According to Donald Norman, a perceived affordance is “how users interpret and perceive the function of a device.” Physical objects and digital interfaces both often exhibit certain perceived affordances through their design. Flat panels on doors suggest to users that the door opens outwards and can be pushed, while grab bars or handles suggest the door opens inward and needs to be pulled. Color is a big component of perceived affordance; for example, if there is a red button and a green button on screen, most people would assume that red means cancel or stop, and green means go.</p>

            <h4>Constraint</h4>
            <p>A constraint is an imposed limitation or restriction; when talking about design, constraints limit what a user can do and often try to direct a user to a certain course of action. Constraints can be physical, logical, or cultural. Physical constraints are those visibly and intentionally present to prevent certain actions. Logical and cultural constraints are quite similar, and are often learned through experience and user expectations. These can sometimes involve the use of reason or context clues.</p>

            <h4>Feedback</h4>
            <p>Visibility can help guide user interaction, as can invisibility. For example, certain options can be omitted as to fully prohibit those possibilities.</p>

            <h4>Visibility</h4>
            <p>Feedback communicates to users the current status of their action. These are most often visual or audible cues, such as status lights or chimes.</p>

            <h4>Mapping</h4>
            <p>Mapping is “the presentation of controls that mirror the operation to be performed or through positioning or proximity, indicate the device or component associated with the control.” This can occur in many ways, such as with car side mirror controls or stove knobs. In the digital realm, this is often seen through certain spacing and placement to make controls and selection options less confusing.</p>
