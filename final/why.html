            <h2>WHY</h2>

            <h3 id="terms">Terms & Definitions</h3>
            <p><strong>disability: </strong>a physical, mental, cognitive, or developmental condition that impairs, interferes with, or limits a person's ability to engage in certain tasks or actions or participate in typical daily activities and interactions</p>
            <p><strong>accessibility: </strong>the concept of being easily used or accessed by people with disabilities</p>
            <p><strong>digital divide: </strong>the economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and online access and those who do not</p>

            <h3 id="demographics">Disability Demographics and Digital (In)accessibility</h3>
            <p>Across the globe, a sizable portion of the population has one or more disabilities. In 2022, an estimated 13.4% of the US population considered themselves to have a disability. This works out to be over 44 million people.</p>
            <p>Technology is becoming an ever-increasingly important part of our lives. Thus, it is more important now than ever that technology is made accessible to ensure equitable access for all. Approximately 96.2% of the US population in 2023 relies on mobile devices to access the Internet, and that number is expected to grow as mobile devices become easier to acquire. Mobile accessibility hasn't always been a priority, but it is vital that interfaces and technologies are designed to work for everyone on any device.</p>

            <h3 id="history">History of the Internet and the Accessible Web</h3>
            
            <p>In 1999, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) were created by W3C in an effort to better digital accessibility for users with disabilities. There have since been modifications and updates along with several new versions, all of which outline specific, technical requirements for websites to be considered accessible.</p>
